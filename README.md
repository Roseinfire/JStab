# About
It's planned to create a command-line utility which can set tabulation for JavaScript. <br>
Project currently exists as JS and is under testing.
# Current version
Function takes `<input>` node, number of spaces adding and number of spaces by default <br>
JStab puts the input value with complete tabulation, separate functions and alerts whether not all quotes were closed.
